# Scheduler

In the summer semester, I was doing a workout in a group of 4-7 people. When we had 4+ people: it was so hard to choose the meeting time. So I decided to create a simple website which tells when is the next meeting.

## Getting Started 👇

You have a calendar where you can have time intervals. If another person added a time interval, which intersects your one, you get a matching time. The next meeting schedules such that the majority of people could start at their preferred time.

### Login 👋

Log in to your account at the right top corner. If you want to use it without signing up, you can try the demo as well. Make sure you don't provide any personal data!

Yay! Somebody created the group, and now we can join. Let's do it. To join the group, follow the previous steps, but click the 'Join' button instead.

## Groups View 📜

We added or joined some groups. Now we can access them through the 'My groups' button on the top navbar. Or, if you are on the main page, click on a huge blue banner.

### Add time interval  🕑

Most important function! Click on the row of preferred time and again for the next time. Double click on start time removes the time-adding-view. The time in the view on the bottom of the screen is clickable for easier time picking :)
